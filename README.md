protein_folding
===============

Code needed for the protein folding project in CS4414

The code was inteded to be used with the "protein_t" input provided through
I/O redirection.  Tested on a machine with an Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM,
and poor cooling, the simulation takes about 4 minutes to run.
